            <p>In the RO process there is a lot of wastewater but in our model, we are trying to minimise the waste by using both osmosis and the reverse osmosis process. Here first the supply water( mainly tap water) undergoes RO and we get pure water. Then the wastewater goes under osmosis with the charcoal treated tap water resulting in a decrease in impurity concentration of the wastewater. After this water undergoes RO with pure water to obtain pure water. And again the wastewater undergoes the previously mentioned cyclic process which causes the zero wastage of water.</p>

            <p>Universal Authentication is a method for verifying the identity of users on a specific website without asking for the same identification every time the user moves from one site to the other. The user need not to input his/her security details again every time a new mode is encountered. To enter into the sites the only thing to do is just scan your iris with your camera. It takes the required data like the intricate structure of your iris and stores it in the database and when you want to access your account the second time, it just searches for the required match if found it gives access.</p>

            <p>The prototype consists of a mobile application and detection box which will be fixed with the bike. The box and the mobile application will be connected via wi-fi. In the application we will use the GPS locating and messaging facility of the phone, which will be used to inform the selected contact and nearby hospital about the accident. The function of the detection box will be to sense an accident and will send a signal to the mobile of the user,which will ultimately send a distress signsl to the 2 trusted contact choosen by the user and the nearby hospital along with the location of accident.</p>

            <p>Kitchen waste water can be treated with a simple oil and grease trap and a planted filter for reuse as garden water. The first thing to do is to trap the oil and grease which can be taken out occasionally and put into a compost heap. The food material is also allowed to settle down and separated from the rest of the water . By applying screening we can remove the other particles present in the water. Other process added to it is sedimentation , oil separator etc . , This remaining water is oxygenated using a small aquarium bubbler. It also consumes less than a half unit of energy every day. About 100 litres to 120 litres of water can be treated and used to water the pots and the garden.</p>

            <p>People from different places migrate to make a living making brooms. They leave their native place and come to stay in temporary structures, make brooms and sell them. However the earnings do not fulfil their basic needs. Objective: The objective is to make a device/tool to assist the broom making process to 1. Increase the safety by making the process less injury prone. 2. Reduce the manual effort in beating the leaves on an assembly of nails. 3. Reduce the time required to produce brooms. 4. Make it easily transportable. 5. It can be easily disassembled/ assembled. It takes maximum 5 minutes to assemble all the parts . 6. When not in use the cycle can be used as a normal bicycle.</p>
